The app is a simple two-activity Android application that allows you to display your personal information in the first activity and demonstrates various activity callbacks in the second activity. Here's a description of the features implemented in the app:

Activity 1: Personal Information

This activity displays your personal information, including your name, registration number, and a photo.
You can customize the layout of this activity to include any additional information you wish to share.
The activity serves as the entry point of the app, showing your personal details when launched.
Activity 2: Activity Callbacks

This activity demonstrates four activity callbacks, which are methods called at different stages of the activity's lifecycle.
The implemented callbacks could include methods like onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), and onPause(), but you can choose any other suitable callbacks.
Each callback method is overridden in the activity and displays a Toast message indicating the current activity state.
Toast messages provide brief notifications to the user, informing them about the activity's lifecycle events.
Navigation between Activities

Both activities have a button that allows you to navigate between them.
Clicking the button in Activity 1 takes you to Activity 2, where you can observe the activity callbacks and Toast messages.
Similarly, clicking the button in Activity 2 takes you back to Activity 1, allowing you to switch between the two activities easily.
Application Icon

The app has a custom application icon that represents the app visually.
You can choose an icon of your choice and set it as the launcher icon for the app.
The launcher icon will be displayed on the device's app launcher screen and represents your app.
The app is designed to showcase your personal information and demonstrate activity callbacks, allowing you to understand and observe the different stages of an activity's lifecycle. The use of Toast messages enhances the interactivity and provides visual feedback to the user regarding the state of the activity. Overall, the app provides a simple and interactive user experience while incorporating the requested features.
